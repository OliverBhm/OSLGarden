# Alligator Noise

A 3d Fractal Alligator noise

## Parameters

**Gain** *Multiplies the amplitude with each iteration*
**Frequency** *Sets the (starting) frequency of the lowest noise layer*
**Octaves** *Number of octaves or noise layers. More octaves add more noise but are slower to compute*
**Offset** *Determines the scale of the frequency of each successive layer/octave of noise. Smaller numbers space them closer while bigger numbers means the layers are further apart*
**Offset** *Determines how strong the falloff applied to the final result is*
